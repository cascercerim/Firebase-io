Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler 

Objective: In this assignment, I'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Technologies used for the app:

HTML5 CSS Bootstrap JavaScript jQuery. Firebase API for database hosting Moment.js

Instructions: Enter the Train Name. Enter the Destination. Enter First Train Time -- in military time. Enter the Frequency -- in minutes. Then the code in the app will calculate using moment.js, how many more minutes are left and the time for the train to arrive, this will be relative to the current time.
